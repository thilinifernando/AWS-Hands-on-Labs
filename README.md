# AWS-Hands-on-Labs
Assignment

First I visited the Cloud Academy web site and studied 6 lab sessions under AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate.
Under that studied

1.	Create First Amazon EC2 Instance (Linux)
2.	Create First Amazon EC2 Instance (Windows)
3.	Managing Instance Volumes Using EBS
4.	Create First Amazon S3 Bucket
5.	Create an EBS-Backed Linux AMI
6.	Create First Amazon RDS Database

And did all these practical using amazon web services by creating an account there.

1)	Create your first Amazon EC2 instance (Linux)

Amazon EC2 is the most famous AWS service and allows to launch different types of cloud instances and pay for them with a pay-per-use approach. It provides complete control of computing resources and allows to run on Amazon’s computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes. This allows to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 allows you to build and configure instances as you like, from your operating system to your applications.
By completing this practical has be able to launch and configure first Amazon EC2 instance using the AWS Management Console.

2)	Create your first Amazon EC2 instance (Windows)

With Amazon EC2 it is possible to create new servers in a few minutes and use different images (AMI) to personalize them. AWS provides several Microsoft Windows Server AMIs that enables to run any compatible Windows-based solution. Users can use Windows-based applications, websites, and web-services written in .NET, for data processing, media trans-coding, and any other task requiring Windows software.
By completing this practical has be able to launch and access your first Amazon EC2 instance running Microsoft Windows Server.

3)	Managing instance volume Using EBS

Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides persistent block level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. Each Amazon EBS volume is automatically replicated within its Availability Zone to protect from component failure. This provides high availability and durability. Amazon EBS volumes offer consistent, low-latency performance needed to run workloads.
By completing this practical learn to create an EC2 instance with an additional EBS volume and to attach and detach an EBS to/from a specific EC2 instance, take a snapshot, and master how to delete a volume.

4)	Create your first Amazon S3 bucket

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), provides secure, durable, and highly-scalable object storage. Amazon S3 allows to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. Users will pay only for the storage actually use with no minimum fee and no setup cost. It can be used alone, or together with other AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), and Amazon Glacier.
By completing this practical studied the bucket creation process and its first usage..

5)	Create an EBS-Backed (Linux AMI)

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an EC2 instance. Here can customize an EC2 instance and then save the configuration as a custom AMI for user private or public use. Every EC2 instance launched selecting the customized AMI will contain any software or file that you've previously added.
During this lab, studied to setup a webserver EC2 instance starting from a Linux AMI, and then generate a new AMI.

6)	Create your first Amazon RDS Database

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. Users can migrate existing applications and tools that utilize a relational database to the Amazon Web Services because Amazon RDS offers access to the capabilities of a MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and the PostgreSQL database engine. Amazon RDS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks. This efficiency frees to focus on applications and business.
This lab is focused on Amazon RDS and by completing this practical learned to create and use first RDS database with Amazon AWS.
